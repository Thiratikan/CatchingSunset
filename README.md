## Inspiration

Of course, everyone loves to travel and see new places. Plus, seeing the sunset in a different location can be inspiring. That's why the web application is called "CathingSunset." However, there are so many stunning places to choose from. It will be easier if we can just random the country and visit. Take risks, have some fun, see the sunset, and get to know the new world and experiences!

## What it does

CatchingSunset is a web application that allows users to pick the destination to travel to randomly. The application also lets people plan their budget, what they need to pay, and how much the whole trip would cost.

## How we built it

We use JSON to store countries' databases and use React JS to create the web application.

## Challenges we ran into

We have to find a way to create a random button to pick the destination. It was challenging and took some time to do. Plus, we have spent a lot of time designing the application to be functional and look good for the users to use.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Everything we have coded goes as we had planned, even though we wanted to add more functions for the application because there is time is limited. We have fun and are happy with the result of the web application.

## What we learned

We have learned how to plan the project. The first step is always important because if there is no plan for the project, we might create so many functions for the application, and it would never be finished before the deadline. Moreover, every step that we programmed the application was very challenging. We ran into errors all the time and had to fix them. Nevertheless, we have completed the project and are very proud of ourselves.

## What's next for CatchingSunset

There will absolutely be more functions for the users to use and play around with. We have some ideas, such as adding random activities for the country or cities that the user will decide to go to, increasing more cities to the database, and more advanced applications by booking and pay the activities or even writing a small diary or reviews for the trip.
